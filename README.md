A public chat room.

Making it the most anonymous texting website.

Theme used is heavily inspired by Fallout's TV Series.

Have fun and take care!

# Notice:

I will add a game function in the future.
As well as a private text room (max of 2 users).
There will also be a createRoom function so that you may invite your friends by their usernames (more than 2 users).

This repo/project is open source. You may built upon or you may download the files and make your own website.
